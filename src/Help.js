                The Wild Battle is a WebApp programmed in React. You can play
                with your favourite Hero in a "Card Game". It's a turn by turn
                game and for each round you have to pick a card. Your choice
                must take into account the "Random Stat". Indeed at the
                beginning of a round, a stat is drawn by lot to determined with
                which stat heroes will fight. For instance, if the Strength is
                choosen, and if your card have a better strength stat than your
                opponent's, you win the round, and the best of the five rounds,
                you win the match.
