# Wild-battle

## Pitch

The **Wild Battle** is a WebApp programmed in **React**. You can play with your favourite Hero in a **"Card Game"**. It's a turn by turn game and for each round you have to pick a card. Your choice must take into account the "Random Stat". Indeed at the beginning of a round, a stat is draw by lot to determined with which stat heroes will **fight**. For instance, if the Strength is choosen, and if your card have a better strength stat than your opponent's, you win the round, and after 3 win, you **win the match**.
